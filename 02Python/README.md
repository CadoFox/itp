## The way of the program
- I did know that arithmetic operations in code are called operators
- I hadn't heard the distinction being referred to as a "Formal Language", and it was kinda cool to find out that stuff like math symbols (or music notation!) are all formal languages!

## Functions
- I did know that pretty much anywhere you can input a value, you can use some sort of expression (although I did not know it couldn't go before assigment statement)
- I did not know that defining a function meant you can just create a function that does what you code it to do when you call on it

## Conditionals and Recursion
- I did know you cnould find if a number is divisble with the modulus operator, however
- I did not know that what it was actually doing is giving the remainder

## Lists
- I did know that the way to access an item in a list is with an index value
- I did not know that in Python, lists can be anything
