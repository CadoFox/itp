## First steps: setting up variables with the math operations

### I basically just used two variables, created a formatted string, and then just did the math inside the formatted string between the curly brackets

## Next: Print

### In the interest of practicing how they work, I decided to define a function and then call it for this process, instead of just using print function itself (it was also fun to call the function "Mice" lol)

### used \n and \t to format the string according to the requirements
