# Pyramids

## How it Works
### The final version works by using the stacks variable as both the input and the counter, decreasing it with each repetition.
### I then use a second varaible to track the current layer, allowing me to use that value for the spaces
### Those two variables then get incremented and decremented accordingly with every repetition of the "for i in range" loop I used

### When put together, the two variable become inversely proportional, allowing them to combine them into the desired pyramid. 
### The program first checks that the input is within range, and then checks the current layer as it runs to makes sure that the for loop only happens when its within the amount of layers inputted in the beginning

## Debugging / Cleanup

## Counter
### The initial versions of this program that I tried included a 3rd variable, labeled "layers left", which i would then assign the same value as the "stacks" variable. I initially did this so that I could be sure I wasn't breaking anything by messing with the value that the user inputs, but I realized this was reduntand and using the input variabla also as the counter itself did not affect the functionality

## Failed Version 2
### while looking through notes from last weeks class, I remembered what we did with the nested "for" loops. I thought I might try to use that instead of what was a much more convoluted initial version, however, as I kinda worked on both versions in tandem, my initial version became more concise while the version with the code from the notes kept getting more complicated as more issues came up, and utimately failed
### My specififc issue with it was that I could not get the spaces to print before the hashes AND on the same line, since unlike the final version, each hash was being generated by each repetition, rather than contatenated with a value from a variable

## Cleaning up
## Once I realized I could get rid of the "layers left" variable, I toyed with the idea of maybe even getting rid of the layer variable as well and unstead using the "i" value. Ultimately, I could not get this to work, as I could not figure out how to get the print function to concatenate based off of the place in the "for" loop. I do still think this is possible, and if I had more time I would have continued with this line of thinking until I got it working, but in the itnerest of the assignment, the version with the "layer" variable works


# Fizz Buzz

## How it Works
### Very simple solution, the program just checks for numbers with both first using "and" with the two modulos, then moves on to two other "elifs" for each individual ones so that its only 1 of the three cases at a given number

## After thoughts
### I managed to get the desired output on first try with this one. I think if I had more time i would explore cleaning this program up even further and using nested conditions, but I personally dont feel like it would be any more efficient than this solution. Also, I feel like this version is a little easier to read this way.
