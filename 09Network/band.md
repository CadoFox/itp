Every group member submits an individual markdown file to Canvas. The markdown file
must include:
- A hyperlink to the site you all made
- Problems faced, decisions made (as in other weeks)
- A self-assessment of how you contributed to the group
- Short assessments of your group members and the contributions they made


# BAND PROJECT: The "The Band" Band

[The "The Band" Band](https://oldshoes3.github.io/)

## Problems Faced

### We honestly didnt face very many problems. Our biggest one was figuring out how to collaborate on the code, but once that was figured out, we came to an agreement on everyone's roles and just got to work! One small bump in the road was managing conflicts when we missed on communicating who was pushing when. There was a small freak out moment with that, but we worked together and came to a solution that ende up working out

## Self-Assesment

### My role was to handle the CSS of the site, since I happen to be the most comfortable in CSS. I was in communication with them on all the changes, and implementing the style went smoothly. I also helped with formatting the HTML code a bit to keep things readable, and helped translate creative decisions into the necessary CSS.

## Other Member Assessment

### They both did great! We kinda split up roles into specific tasts, so I was CSS, someone was HTML, and the other was asset creation and inputing content into text fields. This allowed us to sort of work in parallel, and they both handled their ends of things well, and held up their ends of the project!
