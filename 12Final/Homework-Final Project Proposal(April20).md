# Final Project Proposal - "CadoFox.com" Portfolio Website

## I am creating a purpose built and stylish website for my audio-visual project, "CadoFox"

## Feature Goals and Execution

My main goal for this website is to have an all in one hub I can send people to for literally anything related to the CadoFox project. I produce music, make visual art, take commissions, and play shows, so I would like all of those things to have a place on this website. On top of being very practical, I am after a very minimal and sophisticated look, that puts the emphasis on the visual direction I have for the CadoFox project, with a focus on the visual aspect for the main landing page.

[CBU3D](CBU3D.com) is a friend of mine, and his website is a perfect example of what I mean, and I will be drawing a lot of inspiration (and possibly some bits of HTML haha, he built it with an editor) from it, with plenty of differences to make it my own.

The jumping point for this website is a template I found from the website that was provided, that I will be modifying heavily to fit my needs. This will involve lots of looking at documentation, as the template is quite sophisticated and has a lot of existing moving parts. However, I feel that the things I would like to implement have a nice sliding scale from purely functional to fancy looking, so getting to a working website I can continue to expand upon is attainable

## Good Outcome

- Landing page with simple image showcasing either myself or some of my art, as well as my logo and website slogan. Sleek design with not much else visible except navigation button and mini logo up at the top left

- An about me section, also with a simple image background and a concise introduction of me, my background, and what I do

- A services section where I quickly outline what I offer as a graphic and motion designer, and provide my contact email

- Some place with a bunch of button links to all my current social platforms and music hosting pages

- A simple "works section" with stills of a bunch of my completed works

- Basic stylization with default list of available fonts and template's existing button and icon images

## Better Outcome

- Landing page with animated background showcasing my animated visual art, as well as my logo and website slogan. Sleek design with not much else visible except floating navigation button (transparent header) and mini logo up at the top left

- An about me section, also with an animated background and a concise introduction of me, my background, and what I do.

- A services section with an animated background where I quickly outline what I offer as a graphic and motion designer

- A pretty "works section" with stills and autoplaying videos of a bunch of my completed works

- A simple shows section with simple list of shows I am currently booked for in the future, as well as links to where to buy tickets (I actually have a show to put there if I get this far!)

- A nice looking footer with platform specific icon buttons to link to all my socials and music hosting places

- Advanced stylization with site-wide custom font implementation, as well as custom button images

- A working contact form for visitors to fill out that properly sends me an email with all the right info

## Best Outcome

- Landing page with animated background showcasing my animated visual art, as well as my logo and website slogan. Sleek design with not much else visible except floating navigation button (transparent header) and animated mini logo up at the top left

- A series of simple "showcase" divs, with no text or graphics, containing auto-playing looped videos showcasing some of my visuals work. Ideally 3 - 5 immediately after intro section, so that visitors are forced to scroll past it and hopefully get their eye caught on something. Subtle scroll animations and videos anchored so that the scroll looks more like a moving window (see [CBU3D](CBU3D.com))

- An about me section, also with an animated background and a concise introduction of me, my background, and what I do.

- A services section with an animated background where I quickly outline what I offer as a graphic and motion designer

- A pretty "works section" with stills and autoplaying videos of a bunch of my completed works, all clickable to open a description for each one

- A more sophiscticated and pretty looking shows section with list of shows I am currently booked for in the future, showcasing lineup poster art, as well as links to where to buy tickets (real show gonna be there!)

- A nice looking footer with platform specific icon buttons to link to all my socials and music hosting places, and another fun lil animated thing somewhere

- Advanced stylization with site-wide multiple custom font implementation, as well as custom button images 

- A nice looking customized contact form for visitors to fill out that properly sends me an email with all the right info


## Next Steps

The basic functions for this website are not too hard, and I thankfully have some existing HTML knowledge under my belt to help me (Tried to build this before, failed lol). Overall, a lot of the learning is going to be through trial and error. The cool thing I have discovered is I can get around the deploy time of GitHub pages by just pushing all the assets and placeholder HTML and CSS to the site, and then working with the website via the inspector built into chrome! Since it has access to all the assets I have pushed, I can see my changes happen in real time. This lets me work on my code, watch my changes happen, and when I get the result I want, I simply copy over the new code over to the IDE, save, push, and continue working. Its great!

I anticipate some of the more sophisticated features like scroll animations, making the website FULLY responsive to mobile, clickable videos, etx will be difficult to not only implement, but search for. I do imagine it may be useful to, in good faith, use the LLM as a tool to learn how to do those more advanced features. This will always be my last resort of course, and I will always prioritize learning over results, even if it means sacrificing functionality to maintain authenticity

## Resources I Will Use

- W3 schools, other HTML/CSS references
- Peeking at the source code of websites with features I want 
- Possibly chatGPT/ other LMM with hard to search for issues (specific issues, I will still always be writing and implementing the code myself)
- Template from the website provided as a jumping off point
